[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) is a really wonderful toolkit to bring-up Jekyll in github.
I had suffered this issue for long time, until I found the introduction of it
here: (<http://www.yangzhiping.com/tech/github.html>)

I had a try immediately, and it's ammazing!

Yeah, I will put my blog or technical collections here :-)

note: after some study, seems octopress is better? see
